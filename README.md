CraveWave ~ Chatbot Project for Food Delivery Website
- By Ishita Bhatia
  
Introduction
This report outlines the development of a basic PHP chatbot for a food delivery website. The
primary goal of this project is to create an interactive chatbot that can assist users in placing
food orders, answering common queries, and improving the overall user experience on the
website. The chatbot will be implemented using PHP and a database for storing relevant
information.

Project Overview

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Create a user-friendly chatbot that can engage with website visitors.
2. Provide assistance to users in placing food orders, answering frequently asked questions,
and guiding them through the ordering process.
3. Integrate the chatbot with a database to store and retrieve user information, order details, and
chat history.

Technologies Used
- PHP: Used for chatbot logic and server-side scripting.
- MySQL Database: Utilized to store user data, order information, and chat history.
- HTML/CSS: For creating the user interface of the chatbot.
- JavaScript: For enhancing user interaction.
  
System Architecture
The chatbot system is comprised of the following components:
1. Front-end Interface: A web-based chat interface where users can interact with the chatbot.
2. Chatbot Logic (PHP): The server-side script responsible for processing user input, generating
responses, and communicating with the database.
3. MySQL Database: Stores user profiles, order details, and chat history.
   
Chatbot Features
- User Interaction
The chatbot interacts with users in a conversational manner, providing a natural and
user-friendly experience. It can understand and respond to text-based input, allowing users to
place orders, inquire about menu items, or ask general questions.
- Order Placement
Users can place food orders by adding items to cart. The chatbot guides users through the
order process, collecting the necessary information and storing the order details in the
database.
- FAQ Support
The chatbot is equipped with a set of predefined frequently asked questions and answers,
enabling it to address common queries. Users can ask questions like "where is my order?" or
"can you cancel my order?" and receive relevant answers and actions.
- Order Status Tracking
Users can inquire about the status of their orders by providing their order number. The chatbot
retrieves the order status from the database and provides the user with the latest information.
- Database Integration
The MySQL database stores user profiles, order details, and chat history. This integration allows
the chatbot to personalize interactions, maintain a record of user activity, and retrieve order
information when needed.

Development Process:
The development process can be summarized as follows:
1. Database Design: Create the MySQL database schema to store user information, order
details, and chat history.
2. Front-end Implementation: Develop the chatbot interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can interact with the chatbot through this interface.
3. Chatbot Logic (PHP): Write the PHP script for chatbot logic, handling user input, generating
responses, and communicating with the database.
4. Database Connectivity: Implement database connectivity to store and retrieve user
information, order details, and chat history.
5. FAQ Implementation: Populate the chatbot with frequently asked questions and answers.
6. Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test the chatbot to ensure it functions correctly, handles
different scenarios, and provides accurate responses.
7. Deployment: Deploy the chatbot on the food delivery website for users to access and interact
with.

Conclusion:
The development of a basic PHP chatbot for a food delivery website enhances the user
experience by providing real-time assistance in placing orders and answering common queries.
The chatbot's integration with a MySQL database enables it to personalize interactions and
maintain a record of user activity. This project aims to streamline the food ordering process and
improve user engagement on the website, ultimately contributing to a more satisfying customer
experience.
Future enhancements to this project could include natural language processing (NLP)
capabilities, integration with payment gateways, and the ability to handle more complex user
interactions.
The successful implementation of this chatbot can significantly benefit the food delivery website
by increasing user satisfaction, reducing order processing times, and improving overall
efficiency.
